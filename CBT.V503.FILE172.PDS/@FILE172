//*      A lot of these programs are out of date, being written     *   FILE 172

//*      These goodies fall into different categories, as           *   FILE 172
//*      described below.  Assembly of many these programs          *   FILE 172
//*      requires SYS1.AMODGEN.  They have been tested on MVS/XA    *   FILE 172
//*      2.2, and some are known to work on other versions of       *   FILE 172
//*      MVS.  The programs written by me are reasonably well       *   FILE 172
//*      documented, but check that the code is doing what it       *   FILE 172
//*      says it is.  Programs like 'MAPDISK' which have been       *   FILE 172
//*      built up over the years should be viewed with              *   FILE 172
//*      suspicion, especially the preamble. All JCL should be      *   FILE 172
//*      viewed as being illustrative only, as a lot of junk        *   FILE 172
//*      tends to get left in as comments or unused ddnames.        *   FILE 172

//*      0nce upon a time (1982) I wrote a program which would      *   FILE 172

//*      sysout which you did not want to print. I subsequently     *   FILE 172
//*      used commercial sysout managers including INFOPAC and      *   FILE 172
//*      SAR.  With the advent of System Managed Storage I          *   FILE 172
//*      thought my little external writer could be made just as    *   FILE 172
//*      good or better than those, so I did. This code will        *   FILE 172
//*      archive your sysout on disk where HSM can manage it. It    *   FILE 172

//*      A set of programs to compress sequential files. I got      *   FILE 172

//*      so found a way to be able to keep SMF data online          *   FILE 172
//*      without consuming vast amounts of disk space.  'SSDC02'    *   FILE 172
//*      achieves about 40 percent space reduction by duplicate     *   FILE 172
//*      byte compression. In order to be able to manipulate        *   FILE 172
//*      compressed files directly I use the facilities of          *   FILE 172
//*      DF/SORT via E15 exits. In response to the poor results     *   FILE 172
//*      achieved by 'SSDC02' when shrinking user files that had    *   FILE 172
//*      few repeating characters, I wrote a program calling the    *   FILE 172
//*      Huffman tree compaction routine from 'ARCHIVER', by        *   FILE 172
//*      Richard A. Fochtman (CBT file 147). On SMF data this       *   FILE 172
//*      program gives output about 10 percent smaller than         *   FILE 172
//*      'SSDC02'. However, to expand the data takes three times    *   FILE 172
//*      as much CPU time as using 'SSDCE15'.  I later wrote        *   FILE 172
//*      DCPCOMP1 to improve on SSDC02 and then DCPCOMP2 for SMF    *   FILE 172
